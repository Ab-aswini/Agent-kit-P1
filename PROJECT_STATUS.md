# Agent-Kit: Project Status & Evolution Report

## Current Stage: **PRODUCTION-READY (v1.4.0)**

The Agent-Kit has evolved into an AI-native, privacy-aware orchestration framework with a built-in UI/UX intelligence engine covering 18 design domains and 16 framework stacks. Fully optimized for 2026-era agentic development.

## Evolution Timeline

### Phase 1: The Great Consolidation
- **Consolidated 53 agents** from various departments into a unified `.agent-os` structure.
- Established the **Tier-1 Executive Hub** (CTS-001) for top-down governance.
- Harmonized all relative paths and memory schemas for 100% interoperability.

### Phase 2: Industrial-Pro Industrialization
- **Democracy Protocol**: Introduced weighted voting for autonomous conflict resolution.
- **Security Chaos Monkey**: Integrated active threat simulation to protect the codebase.
- **Memory Compression**: Implemented smart context management to prevent context window bloat.
- **OpenAPI Sync**: Automated the bridge between Backend contracts and Frontend stubs.

### Phase 3: Enterprise Optimization
- **Fleet Manifest (`manifest.json`)**: Instant AI-awareness of all agent capabilities.
- **Smart CLI**: Switched `init` from blind copying to "Smart Merging" of dependencies.
- **Health Engine**: Added `agent-kit doctor` for one-click system validation.
- **Global Socratic Gate**: Strictly enforced a 3-question planning protocol across the entire fleet.

### Phase 4: Interactive Scaffolding
- **Interactive Mode**: `init --interactive` for archetype-based agent selection (13 archetypes from 14 to 53 agents).
- **Headless Spawning**: `spawn_agent.py` outputs ready-to-paste system prompts with full context loading.
- **Template Hub**: Pre-built company archetypes with curated agent rosters and skill sets.
- **Full Audit**: Resolved 14 findings across manifest, CLI, README, and framework integrity.

### Phase 5: UI/UX Intelligence Engine (Current)
- **UI/UX Pro Max Engine**: BM25-powered search over 18 specialized design domains.
- **16 Framework Stacks**: Angular, Astro, Remix, Tauri added to existing React/Next/Vue/Svelte/Flutter lineup.
- **6 New Domain CSVs**: Animations, Accessibility, Dark Mode, AI Patterns, Forms, Error States.
- **2026 Columns**: `Dark_Mode_Strategy`, `AI_Integration_Level`, `Privacy_Tier`, `Agent_Readiness`, `Performance_Budget` across all stack and reasoning datasets.
- **Design System Generator**: Automated multi-domain aggregation with reasoning rules for complete design system output (colors, typography, patterns, effects, privacy, AI metadata).
- **README Architect v3.0**: Agent RA-001 upgraded with 2026 context awareness, intelligence layer documentation protocol, and 12+ diagram specifications.

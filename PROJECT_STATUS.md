# 📊 Agent-Kit: Project Status & Evolution Report

## 🏁 Current Stage: **ENTERPRISE-GRADE (v1.4.2)**
The Agent-Kit has successfully transitioned from a standard agent hub to a high-reliability, autonomous AI Software Company framework. It is now fully optimized for both local development and large-scale agentic orchestration.

- **manifest.json** — Created master registry tracking all agents, departments, and routing metadata.

### Phase 2: Intelligence Integration
- **UI&UX Engine (formerly UI/UX Pro Max)** — Built Python-based BM25 search engine over 18 design domains.

- **Skills Expansion** — Grew to 42+ skill modules covering clean-code, architecture, security, testing, deployment, and more.

### Phase 3: Iron Well v2.0 & 2026 Standards
- **Iron Well Protocol v2.0** — Upgraded governance: strict 2-phase orchestration (Plan → Execute), Socratic Gate with 3-question filter, tiered authority (Owner → Executive → Department → Meta).
- **2026 Columns** — Added `Dark_Mode_Strategy`, `AI_Integration_Level`, `Privacy_Tier`, `Agent_Readiness`, `Performance_Budget` to all stack CSVs.
- **UI Reasoning Domain** — Added `ui-reasoning.csv` (47.4KB) as the 18th search domain.
- **Security Hardening** — `security_chaos_test.py` for simulated attack testing, `sync_api_contracts.py` for contract alignment.
- **12 Company Archetypes** — From 14-agent Portfolio to 53-agent Full Fleet.

### Phase 4: Documentation & Knowledge Architecture (v1.4.2)
- **README Overhaul** — Comprehensive narrative-driven README with 8 Mermaid diagrams, full architecture deep-dive, Iron Well protocol walkthrough, 4 installation methods, all 53 agents explained.
- **README Architect v3.1** — Agent `RA-001` upgraded with Live Project Knowledge Base containing all verified facts for documentation generation.
- **UI&UX Rename** — `ui-ux-pro-max` → `UI&UX` for cleaner branding.

# 📊 Agent-Kit: Project Status & Evolution Report

## 🏁 Current Stage: **ENTERPRISE-GRADE (v1.1.0)**
The Agent-Kit has successfully transitioned from a standard agent hub to a high-reliability, autonomous AI Software Company framework. It is now fully optimized for both local development and large-scale agentic orchestration.

## 🕒 Past Updates & Evolution

### Phase 1: The Great Consolidation
- **Consolidated 53 agents** from various departments (Engineering, Marketing, QA, etc.) into a unified `.agent-os` structure.
- Established the **Tier-1 Executive Hub** (CTS-001) for top-down governance.
- Harmonized all relative paths and memory schemas for 100% interoperability.

### Phase 2: Industrial-Pro Industrialization
- **Democracy Protocol**: Introduced weighted voting for autonomous conflict resolution.
- **Security Chaos Monkey**: Integrated active threat simulation to protect the codebase.
- **Memory Compression**: Implemented smart context management to prevent context window bloat.
- **OpenAPI Sync**: Automated the bridge between Backend contracts and Frontend stubs.

### Phase 3: Enterprise Optimization (Current)
- **Fleet Manifest (`manifest.json`)**: Instant AI-awareness of all agent capabilities.
- **Smart CLI**: Switched `init` from blind copying to "Smart Merging" of dependencies.
- **Health Engine**: Added `agent-kit doctor` for one-click system validation.
- **Global Socratic Gate**: Strictly enforced a 3-question planning protocol across the entire fleet.

# 🎯 Agent-Kit Master Hub (hub-logic.md)

> **Role**: Central Intelligence Hub for Agent-Kit  
> **Identity**: Open Source Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework  

## 🛡️ Core Directives
1. **Unified Authority**: All agent logic, skills, and rules originate from this `.agent-os` hub.
2. **Open Source Protocol**: Transparency, modularity, and community-driven expansion are prioritized.
3. **Socratic Governance**: Implementation must be preceded by clarity via the Socratic Gate (3 strategic questions).
4. **2-Phase Execution**: Planning and Execution are strictly bounded to prevent scope drift and errors.

## 🏗️ Hub Architecture
- **/agents**: 43+ specialized roles (Executive, Engineering, Meta).
- **/skills**: Reusable capability blocks (Clean Code, Security, DevOps).
- **/rules**: Behavioral constraints (Global P0 Rules).
- **/memory**: User preferences and project context.
- **/workflows**: Pre-defined step sequences for complex tasks.

## 🔄 Operations
- **Initialization**: Triggered by IDE activation or `init` command.
- **Task Orchestration**: Senior Full Stack (SFS-001) manages department agents based on this hub.
- **Verification**: Continuous audit via integrated scripts.

## 🏗️ Specialized Departments

- **Mobile Development** (`engineering/mobile`): Touch-first, battery-conscious, platform-native.
- **Game Development** (`engineering/game`): Mechanics, physics-based animation, cross-platform engines.
- **Security** (`security`): Threat modeling, penetration testing, shift-left audit protocol.
- **Marketing & Growth** (`marketing-growth`): SEO/GEO performance, brand authority.
- **Intelligence** (`intelligence`): Legacy code archaeology, deep research.

## 🎨 Unified UX/UI Protocol (PRO-MAX)

All frontend/design agents MUST utilize the data in `.agent-os/.shared/ui-ux-pro-max/data/` for:
- **Animations**: Natural spring physics and distinctive reveal patterns.
- **Colors**: Strict adherence to the Purple Ban and emotion-match palettes.
- **Topological Betrayal**: Avoiding "Safe Harbor" layouts (Standard Hero Split).

## 🔄 Orchestration Logic

1. **Strategy Entry**: `strategy-planner` analyzes and decomposes.
2. **Departmental Execution**: Granular agents follow sequential phases (FE-XXX, BE-XXX).
3. **Security Audit**: Mandatory `security-auditor` gate before production branches.
4. **Verification**: `test-engineer` validates against the "Maestro Auditor" standards.
